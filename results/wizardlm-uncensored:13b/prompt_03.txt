We can use a proportion to solve this problem:

Number of hours to dry 20 shirts : Number of hours to dry 5 shirts = Amount of time for 20 shirts : Amount of time for 5 shirts

Let's call the amount of time it takes to dry 20 shirts "x". Then we can set up the following proportion:

x : 4 = 20 : 5

Now we need to solve for "x". We can do this by cross-multiplying and simplifying:

x \* 4 = 20 \* 5

36 = 100

Therefore, it would take 3.6 hours (or approximately 4 hours) to dry 20 shirts if it takes 4 hours to dry 5 shirts in the sun.
