To find the average speed, we need to divide the total distance by the total time. 

Distance: 480 kilometers 
Time: 6 hours 

Average speed = distance / time 
Average speed = 480 km / 6 hours 
Average speed = 80 km/h 

Therefore, David has to drive at an average speed of 80 km/h to reach his friend's house in 6 hours.
