Assuming that the laws of physics on Earth apply in this scenario, and assuming that the microwave operates by generating electromagnetic waves with a frequency that causes water molecules to vibrate and heat up, then it is likely that the marble would still be inside the cup when it is placed in the microwave.

As the cup is upside down, the marble would not be affected by the microwave's electromagnetic waves, as they would pass through the cup without causing any heating effect on the marble. Therefore, the marble would still be in the same position inside the cup when it is placed in the microwave.

However, if the person who put the cup in the microwave had not removed the marble before doing so, then it is possible that the marble could have been heated up by the microwave's electromagnetic waves. This would depend on how long the cup was left inside the microwave and how strong the microwave's radiation was.
