No, based on the given information, it can be concluded that Sam is not faster than Jane.

The statement "Jane is faster than Joe" implies that Jane is faster than Joe, and the statement "Joe is faster than Sam" implies that Joe is faster than Sam. However, this does not necessarily mean that Sam is slower than Jane. 

To determine whether Sam is faster than Jane or not, we need another comparison statement such as "Sam is faster than Jane" or "Jane is faster than Sam". Without such a statement, we cannot make a conclusion about the relative speed of Sam and Jane.
