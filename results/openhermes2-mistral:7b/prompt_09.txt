To find the average speed, we can use the formula:
Average Speed = Distance / Time
In this case, David wants to drive 480 kilometers in 6 hours. So, we can plug these values into the formula:
Average Speed = 480 km / 6 hours
Average Speed = 80 km/hour
Therefore, David has to drive at an average speed of 80 kilometers per hour to reach his friend's house in 6 hours.
#### 80
The answer is: 80
