Here's a simple algorithm in Node.js that prints numbers 1 through 100 using the `process.stdout` module:

```javascript
for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
  process.stdout.write(`${i}\n`);
}
```

You can run this code in a Node.js environment or in a JavaScript file with a `node` command:

```bash
$ node print_numbers.js
```

This will output the numbers 1 through 100 on the console:

```
1
2
3
4
5
...
98
99
100
```
