If it takes 4 hours to dry 5 shirts, we can find the time it takes to dry one shirt by dividing the total drying time by the number of shirts: 4 hours / 5 shirts = 0.8 hours per shirt (or 48 minutes per shirt).
Now, if it takes 48 minutes to dry one shirt, we can find the time it would take to dry 20 shirts by multiplying the time for one shirt by the number of shirts: 48 minutes * 20 shirts = 960 minutes.
To convert this back to hours, we divide by 60: 960 minutes / 60 = 16 hours.
So, it would take 16 hours to dry 20 shirts in the sun.
