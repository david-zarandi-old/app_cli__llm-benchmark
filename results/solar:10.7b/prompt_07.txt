 The small marble, initially placed inside the upside-down cup, would remain in its position relative to the cup. Since no external forces are acting on the marble or the cup during this scenario, Newton's first law of motion (the law of inertia) states that the marble will continue to stay within the cup as long as it is inside the microwave. The act of lifting the cup and placing it in the microwave did not change its orientation with respect to the marble. So unless some action or force is applied to dislodge the marble, it would remain within the upside-down cup in the microwave. However, it's important to note that this scenario isn't a practical one, as people typically remove any objects from the microwave before use.
