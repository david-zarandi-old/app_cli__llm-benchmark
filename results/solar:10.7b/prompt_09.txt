To find the average speed, we need to divide the total distance by the total time.
The formula for average speed is: Average Speed = Distance รท Time
In this case, David has to cover a distance of 480 kilometers in 6 hours.
So, his average speed = 480 km รท 6 h
Calculating this, we find that David's average speed should be 80 km/h.
