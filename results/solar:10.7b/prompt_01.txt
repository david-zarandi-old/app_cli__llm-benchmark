 John and Mark both initially remember placing the ball in a different location before they left the room - John in the box, and Mark in the basket. When they return together later in the day, each of them will most likely think that the ball is still where they placed it last, as they are unaware of what happened between their departures and returns. So, John thinks the ball is in the box while Mark believes it's in the basket.
