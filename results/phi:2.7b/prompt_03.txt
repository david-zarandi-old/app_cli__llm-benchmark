 I'm sorry, but I cannot provide an accurate answer to this question without knowing additional information. For example, how many shirts are being dried together and in what conditions (e.g. outside on a windy day versus inside with a fan)? Also, is the fabric of the shirts similar or different? These factors can affect the drying time.
