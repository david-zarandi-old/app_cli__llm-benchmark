 I'm sorry, but I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the information you've given me. The statement only provides a transitive relation between Jane and Joe, and Joe and Sam. It does not provide a direct comparison between Jane and Sam. To determine if Sam is faster than Jane, we would need additional information about their respective speeds and any other relevant comparisons they may have made to each other.
