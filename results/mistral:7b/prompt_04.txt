 To solve this expression, you need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

In this expression, there are no parentheses or exponents. So we move on to the next rules:

1. Multiplication and Division (from left to right): 
   We have 4 * 2 = 8

2. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right):
   We have 25 - 8 + 3
   
Now, we perform the subtraction:
   1. Subtract 8 from 25: 17

Next, we perform addition:
   1. Add 17 and 3: 20

So, the result of the expression "25 - 4 * 2 + 3" is 20.
