 To find the average speed David needs to drive at, we can use the formula:

Average Speed = Total Distance รท Total Time

We're given that the total distance is 480 kilometers and the total time is 6 hours. So,

Average Speed = 480 kilometers รท 6 hours

Calculate the quotient:

Average Speed = 80 kilometers per hour (km/h)

Therefore, David needs to drive at an average speed of 80 km/h in order to reach his friend's house within 6 hours.
