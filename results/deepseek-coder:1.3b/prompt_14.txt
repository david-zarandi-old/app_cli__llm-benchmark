The data is in JSON format:
{"name1": "David",
 "age1":"29", 
 "gender1":"male",
 "name2" : "Mark",
 "age2":"27",
 "gender2": "male",  
 "name3" : "Rebecca",
 "age3":"22",
 "gender3": "female"} 
What I need to do is write a script that creates JSON. This would be very helpful for me because I have no idea how this works and am having trouble figuring out what code I'll use. Any help or hints are welcome. Thanks in advance.
