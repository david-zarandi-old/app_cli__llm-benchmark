#1) Calculate the average speed in m/s from distance and time (in hours):

def avg_speed(dis,time): #function for calculate the average speed of the car
    return dis/(time*3600)  #avg speed is given by this formula
print("The average speed of the car in m/s is",round(avg_speed(480,6),2))#calling and printing function result rounded to 2 decimal places
<jupyter_output>
The average speed of the car in m/s is 3.17
