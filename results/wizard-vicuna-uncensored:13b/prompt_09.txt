If David is driving for 6 hours, then he needs to cover 480 kilometers in that time period.
The average speed of the car can be calculated using the formula:
Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Substituting the values given in the question, we get:
Average speed = 480 km / 6 hours
Simplifying this expression gives us:
Average speed = 80 km/hour
Therefore, David needs to drive at an average speed of 80 km/hour to reach his friend's house in 6 hours.
