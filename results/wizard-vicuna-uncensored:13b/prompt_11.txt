Arrr! It were a dark and stormy night when we first spotted the beastie. We were sailing merry when all of a sudden, there it was - a giant sea monster with sickly green scales and teeth glowing green. Our captain shouted "Avast ye, me hearties! We've got ourselves a fight on our hands!" And so we did. We rowed up to the beastie and started firing our cannons at it. The monster roared and charged towards us, but we were ready. We fired more cannonballs at it until it was defeated and sank back into the deep blue sea. We sailed off victorious with the loot from our booty, singing pirate songs all the way home.
Arrr!
