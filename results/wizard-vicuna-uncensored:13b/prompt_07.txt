The ball would be inside the cup, still upside down. When the person lifted up the cup and put it in the microwave, they didn't move the ball itself or the cup relative to each other - they just rotated their grip on the cup. So as long as the marble was inside the cup when it was moved into the microwave, it would remain there.
