Let's assume that the flow rate of water into the tank is constant. The inlet pipe fills the tank at a rate of 25 minutes, so we can set up an equation for this:

Time = Rate x Time (1)

We also know that the drain of the tank empties it at a rate of 55 minutes, so we can set up another equation:

Time = Rate x Time (2)

Since the mistake was not caught until the tank was full, we know that the time when the tank was filled is equal to the time it took to fill up the tank. So we can set up a third equation:

Time = Fill Time + Error Time (3)

where "Error Time" represents the amount of time it took to realize the mistake and close the drain.

From Equation 1, we know that the fill rate is 25 minutes per hour, or 0.4 hours per liter. Let's assume that this constant fill rate applies for the entire filling process, including the error period. This means that the total amount of water in the tank at any given time can be calculated using Equation 1:

Volume = Rate x Time (4)

Now, let's substitute the values we know into Equations 2 and 3:

Time = 0.4 x Volume (5)

Substituting Equation 4 into Equation 5, we get:

Time = 0.4 x (Rate x Time) (6)

Simplifying the right-hand side of Equation 6, we get:

Time = 0.2 x Time^2 (7)

Now, let's solve for the time it took to fill up the tank. We know that the tank was filled in 55 minutes, so we can substitute this value into Equation 7:

0.2 x (55)^2 = 1.83 x 55^2 (8)

Simplifying, we get:

Time = 46.25 minutes (9)

So it took approximately 46.25 minutes to fill up the tank.
