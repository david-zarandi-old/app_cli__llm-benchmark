To find the average speed David must drive at, we can use the formula:

Average Speed = Total Distance / Time

In this case, the total distance is 480 kilometers and the time is 6 hours. So, we can plug these values into the formula to get:

Average Speed = 480 km / 6 hrs
= 80 km/hr

Therefore, David must drive at an average speed of 80 kilometers per hour in order to arrive at his friend's house in 6 hours.
