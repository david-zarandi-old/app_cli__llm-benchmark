Here is a simple algorithm in Node.js that prints 1 through 100 using `process.stdout`:
```javascript
const { stdout } = process;

for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
  stdout.write(`${i}\n`);
}
```
This algorithm uses a `for` loop to iterate from 1 to 100 and print each number on a new line using the `stdout.write()` method. The `${i}` syntax is used to insert the current value of `i` into the string being written to the console.
