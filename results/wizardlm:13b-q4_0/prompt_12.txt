Here's a simple Node.js algorithm that uses `process.stdout` to print numbers from 1 to 100:
```javascript
// Import 'readable-stream/passthrough'.
const { PassThrough } = require('readable-stream');

// Create a readable stream that writes to process.stdout.
const outputStream = new PassThrough();
process.stdout.push(outputStream);

// Loop through numbers 1 to 100 and print them using the output stream.
for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
  console.log(`Printing number ${i}`); // You can remove this if you don't need it in the logs.
  outputStream.write(String(i));
}

// Remove the extra stream added to process.stdout.
process.stdout.pop();
```
This algorithm first imports the `PassThrough` class from the `readable-stream` module, which is used to create a readable stream that writes to `process.stdout`. The output stream is then pushed onto `process.stdout`, and a loop is used to print numbers 1 through 100 using the output stream. Finally, the extra stream added to `process.stdout` is removed, and the example logs the progress to the console.
