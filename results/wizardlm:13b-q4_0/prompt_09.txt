To find the average speed David has to drive at, we can use the formula:

Average Speed = Total Distance / Time

David needs to cover 480 kilometers in 6 hours. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

Average Speed = 480 km / 6 hours

Average Speed = 80 km/h

So, David has to drive at an average speed of 80 kilometers per hour to reach his friend's house in 6 hours.
