Let's denote the inlet pipe's rate of filling as R and the drain's rate of emptying as D. We can set up two equations based on the given information:

1) R + D = 25 (the sum of the rates takes 25 minutes to fill the tank)
2) R - D = 55 (the difference between the rates takes 55 minutes to empty the tank)

We want to find the time it took to fill up the tank, which is equal to D. To do this, we can solve equations 1 and 2 simultaneously for D:

(R + D = 25) => D = 25 - R (equation 1)
(R - D = 55) => D = 55 - R (equation 2)

Now, we will substitute the expression for D from equation 1 into equation 2:

(25 - R) = 55 - R

Combine the constants:

-30 + R = 55 - R

Move the R term to the other side:

30 = R

So, it took 30 minutes for the tank to fill up after the drain was left open by mistake.
