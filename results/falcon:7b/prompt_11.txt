Captain: "Ahoy, me hearties! 'Tis a mighty creature we be fightin' this day!" 
The sea monster's scales glowed green in the moonlight as it emerged from the depths, its maw gaping wide and filled with razor-sharp teeth. "Arrgh! Me crew, prepare for battle! 'Tis a battle we'll fight to the end!" 
The pirates raised their cutlasses high and charged, their salty sea chants filling the air as they battled the giant green beast with the courage and bravery of the sea. In the end, they emerged victorious, with the monster's scales and teeth no longer glowing green, but instead, turned to a dull, sickly grey. 
The pirates were rewarded with a treasure trove of gold and silver, their captain standing tall at the helm. "Ahoy, me hearties! 'Tis a day we'll never forget!"
