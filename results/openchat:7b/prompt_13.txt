 The given algorithm is a recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence. The time complexity of this function can be determined by analyzing the number of times the function calls itself.

Let's denote the number of times the function is called as `k`. When the base case `n < 2` is reached, the function stops calling itself and returns either `n` or `1`, depending on the value of `n`. The base case is reached after 0, 1, or 2 recursive calls.

In the worst case scenario, we can observe that each recursive call generates two new calls to the function (`f(n - 1) + f(n - 2)`). This means that for every call, there are effectively 2 more calls being made (including the current call). Therefore, the total number of calls can be represented as:

```
k = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + ... + 2^(log2(n))
```

This is a geometric progression with a common ratio of 2. We can use the formula for the sum of a geometric progression to find the total number of calls:

```
k = (2^(log2(n) + 1) - 1) / (2 - 1)
```

Since `log2(n)` is usually much smaller than `n`, we can approximate this formula as:

```
k â‰ˆ 2^n
```

Therefore, the time complexity of the given algorithm is exponential, specifically O(2^n).
