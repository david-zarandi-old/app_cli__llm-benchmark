 Let the rate at which water enters the tank be x and the rate at which water exits the tank be y. We know that 

x - y = 1/25 (since it takes 25 minutes to fill the tank)
y = 1/55 (since it takes 55 minutes to empty the tank)

Substituting the value of y in the first equation, we get:

x - 1/55 = 1/25

Adding 1/55 to both sides, we get:

x = 1/25 + 1/55

To find a common denominator, we can use the least common multiple of 25 and 55, which is 550.

x = (22 * 550) / 550 + (11 * 550) / 550

x = 22/550 + 11/550

x = 33/550

Now, to find the time it takes to fill up the tank, we can use the formula:

Time = 1 / (x - y)

Substituting the values of x and y, we get:

Time = 1 / ((33/550) - (1/55))

Time = 1 / (33/550 - 10/55)

To find a common denominator, we can use 550.

Time = 1 / ((33 * 11) / (550 * 11) - (10 * 550) / (550 * 11))

Time = 1 / ((363/550) - (5500/550))

Time = 1 / ((363 - 5500) / 550)

Time = 1 / (-5137 / 550)

Now, we can find the time by taking the reciprocal of this fraction:

Time = -5137 / 550

To the nearest tenth of a minute, the time it takes to fill up the tank is approximately 9.3 minutes.
