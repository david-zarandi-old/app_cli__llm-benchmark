 Here's a simple Node.js script that prints the numbers 1 through 100 using `process.stdout`:

```javascript
// Loop from 1 to 100
for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
  // Print each number followed by a newline character
  process.stdout.write(i + '\n');
}
```

You can save this script in a file, for example `print_numbers.js`, and run it using the following command:

```bash
node print_numbers.js
```

This will print the numbers from 1 to 100 on separate lines in the console output.
