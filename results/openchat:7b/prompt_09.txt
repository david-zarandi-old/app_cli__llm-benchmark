 To find the average speed David has to drive at, we can use the formula:

Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time

In this case, the total distance is 480 kilometers and the total time is 6 hours. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

Average Speed = 480 kilometers / 6 hours = 80 kilometers per hour

So, David has to drive at an average speed of 80 kilometers per hour to reach his friend's house in 6 hours.
