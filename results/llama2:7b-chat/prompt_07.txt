According to the laws of physics on Earth, when the cup was placed upside down on the table, the marble inside the cup would have remained inside the cup. When someone lifted up the cup and put it inside the microwave, the marble would still be inside the cup.

The microwave oven uses electromagnetic waves to heat food and other materials. The microwaves penetrate the cup and heat the marble inside it. However, since the cup is made of a solid material, the marble will not be able to escape from the cup even when the microwaves are heating it up.

So, after the cup is put inside the microwave, the marble will still be inside the cup and will continue to be heated by the microwaves.
