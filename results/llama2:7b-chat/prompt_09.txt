To find the average speed that David needs to drive at, we can use the formula:

Average Speed = Total Distance / Time Taken

In this case, the total distance is 480 kilometers, and the time taken is 6 hours.

So, to calculate the average speed, we can plug these values into the formula:

Average Speed = 480 km / 6 h = 80 km/h

Therefore, David needs to drive at an average speed of 80 kilometers per hour to reach his friend's house in 6 hours.
