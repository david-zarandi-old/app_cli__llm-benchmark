 To find the average speed David needs to maintain, we can use the formula:

Average Speed = Total Distance / Time

In this case, the total distance is 480 kilometers and the time taken is 6 hours. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

Average Speed = 480 km / 6 hr = 80 km/hr

So, David needs to maintain an average speed of 80 kilometers per hour in order to reach his friend's house in 6 hours.
