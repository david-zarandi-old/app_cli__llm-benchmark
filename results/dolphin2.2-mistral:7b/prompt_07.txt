 The marble is now inside the microwave. When you placed the cup upside down on the table, it was still touching the surface of the table, and since the marble was inside the cup, it was also on the table. Then, when you lifted the cup from the table and put it into the microwave, both the cup and its contents (including the marble) were enclosed within the interior space of the microwave. So, currently, the marble is inside the microwave.
