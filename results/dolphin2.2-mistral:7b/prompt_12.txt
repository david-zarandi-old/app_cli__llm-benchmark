 Here's a simple algorithm in Node.js that prints 1 through 100 using `process.stdout`:

```javascript
for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
    process.stdout.write(i + " ");
}
```

When you run this code in a Node.js environment, it will output the numbers from 1 to 100 sequentially without any newline characters. To add newline characters and separate the numbers on different lines, you can modify the code as follows:

```javascript
for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
    process.stdout.write(i + " ");
    if ((i % 10) === 0 && i !== 100) { // Add newline every 10 numbers except for the last one
        process.stdout.write("\n");
    }
}
```

This modified version of the algorithm will output the numbers on different lines, with each line containing ten numbers followed by a newline character.
