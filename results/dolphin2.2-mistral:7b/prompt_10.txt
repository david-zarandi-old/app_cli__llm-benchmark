 Let the time taken to fill up the tank be x minutes. Then, 25x = 100% (because the inlet pipe filled the tank completely). Similarly, (55/2)x = 100% (since the drain is half as effective as the inlet pipe). So, (55/2)x = 50%.

Now we have two equations:

25x = 100%
(55/2)x = 50%

From the first equation, x = 4 minutes. Now plug this value into the second equation to check if it holds true: (55/2)*4 = 77.5/2 = 38.75. However, this result is not a full percentage. This means that the initial assumption of 4 minutes was incorrect.

Try again with x = 3.6 minutes. Now plug this value into both equations:

(25*3.6) = 86.4 (97%) - This means that, in 3.6 minutes, the tank is approximately 97% full. This is still not 100%, which indicates an error in our assumption.

Try with x = 3.2 minutes:
(25*3.2) = 80 (80%) - This result is also incorrect.

With x = 3 minutes, we get closer to 100%:
(25*3) = 75 (75%) - Still not a perfect match.

With x = 2.9 minutes, we get even closer:
(25*2.9) = 72.5 (72.5%) - This is still not a perfect match.

Finally, with x = 2.8 minutes, we find the exact match:
(25*2.8) = 68 (68%) - This means that when the drain was left open by mistake, the tank filled up to about 68% of its capacity in 2.8 minutes before the error was caught and fixed.

Since the tank is full, the remaining percentage must be accounted for by the time it took to fill the last 32%. Given that the drain empties half as fast as the inlet pipe, it takes an additional 14 minutes (since 14*2 = 28) for the drain to empty the tank.

So, in total, the tank was filled up to about 68% of its capacity in 2.8 minutes and then emptied by the drain over the next 14 minutes. Therefore, it took a total of 2.8 + 0.14 = 3 minutes (to the nearest tenth) to fill up the tank with the mistake made.
