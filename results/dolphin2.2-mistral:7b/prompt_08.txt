 Let's analyze the information provided:

1. Jane is faster than Joe.
2. Joe is faster than Sam.

Now let's think about how these facts relate to each other. If Jane is faster than Joe, and Joe is faster than Sam, then Jane must be faster than Sam as well. This is because if Jane can run faster than Joe who can also run faster than Sam, then Jane's speed would surpass that of Sam directly.

So yes, Sam is not faster than Jane.
