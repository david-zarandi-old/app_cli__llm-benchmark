This is a classic lateral thinking puzzle. The solution is not based on the physical location of the ball, but rather on the assumptions and beliefs of John and Mark.

John left the room with the ball in the box, so he will think that the ball is still in the box when he returns.

Mark put the ball in the basket before he left, so he will think that the ball is in the basket when he returns.

Neither John nor Mark knows what happened to the ball after they left the room, so they will both be unsure about where the ball is. This is a classic example of a "Cretan paradox," where two people have conflicting beliefs about the location of an object, and neither one can be proven correct or incorrect.
