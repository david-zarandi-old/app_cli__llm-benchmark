Let's call the time it takes to fill the tank with the inlet pipe "x" minutes.

We know that the inlet pipe can fill the tank in 25 minutes, so we can set up an equation:

x + 25 = 60 (since the tank is filled in 60 minutes)

Now, we also know that the drain can empty the tank in 55 minutes, so we can set up another equation:

x + 55 = 60

Solving the first equation for x, we get:

x = 35

So it took 35 minutes to fill the tank.
