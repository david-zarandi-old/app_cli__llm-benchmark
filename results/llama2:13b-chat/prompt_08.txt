Yes, Sam is faster than Jane.

Here's how we can determine this:

1. We know that Jane is faster than Joe.
2. We also know that Joe is faster than Sam.
3. Therefore, if Sam is faster than Jane, it would mean that Sam is faster than both Jane and Joe, which is not true (according to the information given).
4. Therefore, we can conclude that Sam is not faster than Jane.
