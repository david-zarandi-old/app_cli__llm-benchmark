To find the average speed, we need to divide the distance by the time:

Distance = 480 kilometers
Time = 6 hours

So, we can calculate the average speed as follows:

Average speed = Distance / Time
= 480 km / 6 h
= 80 km/h

Therefore, David has to drive at an average speed of 80 kilometers per hour to reach his friend's house in 6 hours.
