Here is a simple algorithm in Node.js which prints numbers from 1 to 100 using `process.stdout`:

```javascript
for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
process.stdout.write(i + '\n');
}
```

This code uses a for loop to iterate over numbers 1 to 100. On each iteration, it writes the current number (plus a newline character) to `process.stdout`. The newline character allows each number to be printed on a separate line in the console.
