Based on the given information, we have the following relationships:

1. Jane > Joe (Jane is faster than Joe)
2. Joe > Sam (Joe is faster than Sam)

To determine if Sam is faster than Jane, we can analyze these relationships step by step. 

Step 1: Since Joe is faster than Sam, and we know that Jane is faster than Joe, it means that the only possibility for Sam's speed relative to Jane would be slower than Joe but potentially faster than some other person (not necessarily Jane). Let's call this hypothetical "x" for simplicity.

Step 2: Now, since Joe > x (Joe is faster than whatever speed x has), and we also know that Joe > Sam, it implies that Sam must be slower than x.

Step 3: Since Jane is faster than Joe, and considering the relationships between all the mentioned individuals, we can conclude that there's a chain of faster people: Jane → Joe (their speed relation) → x (hypothetical, but clear in comparison to Sam who is slower) → Sam. So, if we assume that Sam's speed relative to Jane remains constant, it would mean that Sam is indeed faster than Jane because their speeds are compared within the same context and against a hypothetical "x."

In conclusion, based on these relationships, we can say that Sam is likely faster than Jane since there is a clear indication that Sam is faster than Jane in relation to Joe (Joe > x).
