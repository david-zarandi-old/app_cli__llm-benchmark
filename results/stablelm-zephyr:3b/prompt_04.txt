The answer is 21.

To solve this equation, we follow the order of operations, which is Parentheses (or Brackets), Exponents (or Braces), Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). 

In this case, there are no parentheses or exponents, so we start with multiplication: 4 * 2 = 8. Then we have addition and subtraction from left to right: 25 - 8 + 3. Finally, we perform the subtraction: 25 - 8 = 17, and then add 3: 17 + 3 = 20. However, this result is not quite correct because we made a mistake earlier by not subtracting the bigger number (25) from the smaller one (3). So we need to subtract 25 from 3 instead: 3 - 25 = -22. 

But there's still a mistake here too. The correct answer should be 20, not -22! This is because we first added 17 and then subtracted 25 instead of adding 3. To fix this, let's add the right numbers together: 4 * 2 + 25 - 3. First, we multiply 4 by 2: 8. Then we add 25 and subtract 3 from it: 25 + 8 = 33, and then 33 - 3 = 30. So the final correct answer is 20 + 30 = 50. But since the original equation doesn't have a sign or parentheses to indicate whether it should be positive or negative, both answers could be valid depending on how you interpret the problem.
