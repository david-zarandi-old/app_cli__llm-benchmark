John and Mark think the ball is in the room, but they are not sure exactly where it ended up after they left. They might think it could be either in the box (if John replaced the ball in the box before he went to work), or in the basket (if Mark placed the ball there when he went to school). Since they don't know what happened during their absence, they can't say for sure where the ball ended up.
