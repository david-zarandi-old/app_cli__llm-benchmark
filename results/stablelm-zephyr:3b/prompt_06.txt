If there are three killers in the room and someone enters and kills one of them, then there are two killers remaining. Since nobody leaves the room, the number of killers in the room is still two. 

Step-by-step justification:
1. Identify the initial number of killers in the room (three).
2. Account for the fact that someone enters and kills one of them (one killer left in the room).
3. Recognize that once a new person enters, there are still two killers remaining in the room (the original three minus the one killed plus the new person).
4. Understand that no one leaves the room, so the number of killers stays at two.
