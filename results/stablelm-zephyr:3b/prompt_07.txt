Given the laws of physics on Earth, when a small marble is placed in a cup and that cup is upside down on a table, it would not be subject to any forces that could cause it to move within the microwave once it has been lifted and set inside. The force exerted by the person lifting the cup is enough to ensure its stability, preventing any movement or displacement due to gravitational forces.

However, there might be some changes in the internal conditions of the microwave when the person lifts the cup containing the marble and puts it inside. Microwaves heat food using electromagnetic radiation, and as a result, they can also transfer energy to certain substances like water molecules contained within the materials of the cup or even the marble itself, causing them to absorb this energy and thus heat up.

When the microwave heats the contents inside, the temperature within the cup (including the marble) will rise rapidly. If the marble were made of a material that conducts heat effectively, such as metal, it would experience an increase in temperature very quickly due to its conductivity. As for materials like plastic or wood that are poor conductors of heat, they might not feel noticeably hotter than their original temperature.

In conclusion, once the person lifts the cup with the marble inside and places it inside the microwave, the position and state of the marble will remain unchanged, as there is no gravitational force acting on it within the confines of the cup. The marble will continue to be in its original location, either on the table or inside the cup, while the surrounding materials – such as plastic, wood, or metal – might experience varying degrees of heat absorption and temperature changes due to the microwave's heating process.
