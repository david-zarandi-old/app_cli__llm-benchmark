Given:
- Distance to the friend's house is 480 kilometers
- Time to travel is 6 hours

Goal: Find the average speed David has to drive at

Steps:
- To find the average speed, we need to divide the distance by the time
- Average speed = distance / time
- Substitute the given values into the formula
- Average speed = 480 km / 6 h
- Simplify the fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 12
- Average speed = 40 km / h
### Final answer: David has to drive at 40 km/h
