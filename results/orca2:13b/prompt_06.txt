Given:
- There are three killers in a room
- Someone enters the room and kills one of them
- Nobody leaves the room

Goal: How many killers are in the room?

Steps:
- Let x be the number of killers in the room after someone enters and kills one of them
- Since nobody leaves the room, the initial number of killers and the final number of killers must be equal
- Therefore, we can write an equation: 3 = x + 1 - 1
- Simplifying the equation, we get: 3 = x
- Hence, the number of killers in the room is 3
### Final answer: 3
