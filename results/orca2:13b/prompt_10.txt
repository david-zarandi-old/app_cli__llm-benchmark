Let's use the formula R = D/S, where R is the rate of filling or emptying the tank (in this case, it's filling), D is the drain rate, and S is the inlet rate. We can rearrange this formula to solve for the time T: T = R * D / S.

We know that the inlet pipe fills the tank in 25 minutes, so its rate is 1/25 of the tank per minute. The drain empties the tank in 55 minutes, so its rate is 1/55 of the tank per minute. Plugging these values into our formula, we get:

T = (1/25) * (1/55) / 1
T = 1 / (25 * 55)
T = 1 / 1375
T ≈ 0.000727272

Converting this to hours and minutes, we get:

T = 0 hours and 0.0046896 minutes
T = 0 minutes and 0.0046896 seconds
T ≈ 0 minutes and 0.04 seconds

So, it took approximately 0 minutes (to the nearest tenth of a minute) to fill up the tank. However, since the mistake wasn't caught until the tank was full, we should also consider the time it takes for the drain to empty the tank:

D = 55 minutes

Therefore, the total time taken is 25 (inlet) + 55 (drain) minutes. However, since the drain was left open and the tank was still filling, the actual time taken is the inlet time of 25 minutes.
