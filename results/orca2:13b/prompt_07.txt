The ball is still in the cup. According to the laws of physics on Earth, an object in a state of uniform circular motion remains in that state unless acted upon by an external force. The ball is rolling inside the cup due to the centripetal force that keeps it from flying off the edge. When the cup is placed upside down, the ball continues to roll along the curved surface of the cup without falling out or changing its speed. Therefore, when someone lifts up the cup and puts it inside the microwave, the ball stays in the cup as well, unless the microwave emits enough radiation to heat up the ball and change its state of motion.
