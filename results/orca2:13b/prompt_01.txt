This is a logic puzzle that requires you to reason about the possible locations of the ball. Here are some steps to solve it:

- First, identify what each person knows and does not know about the state of the room. John knows that he put the ball in the box, but he does not know that Mark moved it to the basket. Mark knows that he put the ball in the basket, but he does not know that John moved it to the box. Neither of them knows what happened after they left the room.
- Second, consider the possible scenarios for where the ball is at the end of the day. There are four options: (A) the ball is still in the box, (B) the ball is in the basket, (C) the ball is somewhere else, or (D) the ball is back in the box.
- Third, eliminate the scenarios that are inconsistent with what each person knows. John can only think that the ball is either in the box or somewhere else, since he saw it there before he left and after Mark left. Mark can only think that the ball is either in the basket or somewhere else, since he saw it there before he left and after John left. Neither of them can think that the ball is back in the opposite location, since they did not see that happen.
- Fourth, determine which scenario is most likely based on the probability of each person's action. John moved the ball to the box when he first entered the room, and Mark moved the ball to the basket after John left. Therefore, it is more likely that the ball was initially in the box than in the basket, since moving the ball twice requires more effort and chance than moving it once. Thus, the most probable scenario is (A) the ball is still in the box.

### Final answer: The ball is still in the box.
