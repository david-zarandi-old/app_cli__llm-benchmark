 Here's a simple algorithm in Node.js that prints 1 through 100 using the `process.stdout` object:

```javascript
for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
  process.stdout.write(`${i}\n`);
}
```

This code uses a `for` loop to iterate from 1 to 100, incrementing the variable `i` by 1 with each iteration. Inside the loop, the `process.stdout.write()` function is used to output the value of `i` followed by a newline character (`\n`), which moves the cursor to the next line after each number is printed.

To use this code in your Node.js program, save it in a file with a `.js` extension (e.g., `print_numbers.js`) and run it using the Node.js command-line interface:

```bash
node print_numbers.js
```

The output will be as follows:

```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
...
98
99
100
```

This algorithm successfully prints the numbers 1 through 100 using the `process.stdout` object in Node.js.
