 John and Mark both assume that the ball is still in its original location when they left the room. Therefore, John thinks the ball is in the box, and Mark thinks the ball is in the basket. They have no way of knowing what happened while they were away, so they can't be sure where the ball actually is. However, based on their assumptions, they would expect to find the ball either in the box or the basket, but not both at the same time.
