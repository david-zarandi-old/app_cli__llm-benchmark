 To solve this expression, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS): Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). 

25 - 4 * 2 + 3 = ?

First, we perform the multiplication:
25 - 8 + 3

Next, we perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:
17 + 3 = 20

Therefore, the answer is 20.
