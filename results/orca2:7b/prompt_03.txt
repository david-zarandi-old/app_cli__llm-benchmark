Given:
- 5 shirts take 4 hours to dry in the sun
- The rate of drying is proportional to the number of shirts

Goal: Find how long 20 shirts would take to dry

Steps:
- Let x be the time (in hours) for 20 shirts to dry
- We can set up a proportion using the given information
- 5/4 = 20/x
- Cross-multiply and solve for x
- 5x = 80
- x = 80/5
- x = 16
### Final answer: 16 hours
