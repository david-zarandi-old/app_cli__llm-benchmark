Given:
- The inlet pipe can fill the tank in 25 minutes
- The drain can empty the tank in 55 minutes
- The mistake was not caught until the tank was full

Goal: Find the time it took to fill up the tank to the nearest tenth of a minute

Steps:
- Let x be the time (in minutes) that the inlet pipe was working alone
- Then the drain was open for (65 - x) minutes
- The total volume of water in the tank is equal to the product of the filling rate and the time
- The filling rate is 1/25, since the inlet pipe can fill the tank in 25 minutes
- The emptying rate is 1/55, since the drain can empty the tank in 55 minutes
- Using the conservation of water principle, we have:

(1/25) * x = (1/55) * (65 - x)

- To solve for x, we multiply both sides by the least common multiple of 25 and 55, which is 55 * 25 = 1375
- We get:

x * 55 = (1/55) * 65 - x * 25

- Simplifying, we have:

55x = 85 - 25x

- Adding x to both sides, we get:

79x = 85

- Dividing by 79, we get:

x = 85 / 79

- Rounding to the nearest tenth of a minute, we get:

x = 1.09

### Final answer: It took 1.09 minutes to fill up the tank.
