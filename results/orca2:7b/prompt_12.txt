To write a simple algorithm in Node.js which prints 1 through 100 using `process.stdout`, we can use the following steps:

- Create a function that takes an integer n as its argument and returns the string representation of n. For example, if n is 42, then return "42".
- Use a loop to iterate over the numbers from 1 to 100. We can use the built-in `for` statement or a `while` loop for this purpose. For example, using a `for` loop, we can write:

```javascript
for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
  let number = Number(i); // Convert the integer to a number object
  process.stdout.write(number + " "); // Write the number followed by a space
}
```

- End the script with a newline character or use `process.exit()` to exit gracefully. For example, we can write:

```javascript
process.stdout.write("\n"); // Write a newline character
process.exit(0); // Exit with code 0
```

Putting it all together, the simple algorithm in Node.js which prints 1 through 100 using `process.stdout` is:

```javascript
function numberToStr(n) {
  let number = Number(n);
  return number + "";
}

for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
  process.stdout.write(numberToStr(i) + " ");
}
process.stdout.write("\n");
process.exit(0);
```
