Given:
- Distance to friend's house = 480 km
- Time to reach the friend's house = 6 hours

Goal: Find the average speed David has to drive at.

Steps:
1. The formula for calculating average speed is:
   Average Speed (A.S.) = Total Distance / Total Time

2. Plug in the given values into the formula:
   A.S. = 480 km / 6 hours

3. Calculate the average speed:
   A.S. = 80 km/h (rounded to the nearest whole number)
