No, Sam is not faster than Jane.

Step 1: Analyze key points from both the parts
- The first part states that Jane is faster than Joe
- The second part states that Joe is faster than Sam
- The question asks if Sam is faster than Jane

Step 2: Show how you are comparing them
- To answer the question, we need to use the transitive property of equality. If A > B and B > C, then A > C
- In this case, we can rewrite the first part as Jane > Joe and the second part as Joe < Sam
- Then we can apply the transitive property as Jane > Joe and Joe < Sam, so Jane > Sam
- Therefore, Sam is not faster than Jane

### Final answer: No
