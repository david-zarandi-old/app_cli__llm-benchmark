This is a question that involves perspective taking and social reasoning. To answer this question, we need to consider what each person knows and believes about the other person's actions and intentions.

- John knows that he put the ball in the box before leaving for work. He does not know or believe that Mark moved the ball from the box to the basket, because that would contradict his own observation and memory. Therefore, John thinks the ball is still in the box when he comes back.

- Mark knows that he put the ball in the basket before leaving for school. He does not know or believe that John moved the ball from the box to the basket, because that would also contradict his own observation and memory. However, he might think that John did not see him move the ball, and that the ball is still in the same place as when Mark left it. Therefore, Mark thinks the ball is either in the box or the basket, but not in both.

- To find out where the actual ball is, we need to consider what a third person would do if they were in the room with the ball, the basket and the box, and did not know anything about John and Mark's actions or beliefs. A reasonable assumption is that a third person would try to put the ball in each container, and see which one it fits best. If the ball fits best in the box, then the ball is in the box. If the ball does not fit well in either the box or the basket, then the ball is somewhere else in the room.

### Final answer: The actual location of the ball depends on whether John or Mark moved it after putting it in the box, but neither of them knows that. A third person would put the ball in each container and see which one it fits best. If the ball fits best in the box, then the ball is in the box. If not, then the ball is somewhere else in the room.
