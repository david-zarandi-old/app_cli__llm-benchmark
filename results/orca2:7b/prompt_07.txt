The ball is likely still inside the microwave, unless it has some special feature that can hold objects in different positions. However, this seems unlikely for a standard microwave oven. A possible explanation is that someone moved the ball out of the cup and into the microwave while it was upside down on the table. If that happened, then the ball could be anywhere inside or outside the microwave, depending on how it was moved. The laws of physics on Earth would still apply to the ball and its interactions with gravity, friction, air resistance, etc., but some of these forces might be different in a microwave oven due to its electric and magnetic fields. However, these effects are usually negligible for small objects like a marble, unless they are very close to or inside the oven when it is running. Therefore, the most likely scenario is that the ball is still inside the microwave, but upside down from how it was originally placed in the cup.
