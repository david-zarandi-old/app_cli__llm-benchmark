No, Sam is not faster than Jane.

The statement "Jane is faster than Joe" means that Jane is physically capable of running at a higher speed than Joe. However, this does not necessarily mean that she is faster than Sam, as we do not have any information about Sam's physical abilities.

Similarly, the statement "Joe is faster than Sam" means that Joe is physically capable of running at a higher speed than Sam. However, this does not necessarily mean that he is faster than Jane, as we do not have any information about Jane's physical abilities.

Therefore, we cannot say for certain whether Sam is faster than Jane or not.
