This is a classic lateral thinking puzzle. The answer is 2.

The puzzle is trying to trick the listener into assuming that there are three killers in the room, based on the statement "Someone enters the room and kills one of them." However, if only one person is entering the room, then there must be two people left in the room who are not being killed. Therefore, there are only 2 killers in the room.
