Let x = time taken to dry 1 shirt (in hours)
Then, the time taken to dry n shirts will be:
x + x + x + ...+x=n(x)
where '+' represents addition.
So, the time taken to dry 20 shirts is given by:
(5)(4)+...+(5)(4)=100(x)
Now, we know that the time taken to dry 5 shirts is 4 hours. So, we can set up an equation and solve for x:
5x=4 (where x represents time in hours)
Solving for x, we get x=8/5 or approximately 1.6 hours.
Therefore, the time taken to dry 20 shirts would be approximately:
(1.6)(20)=32 hours
