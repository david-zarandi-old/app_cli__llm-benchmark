Let x be the time taken to fill up the tank.
From the inlet pipe, it takes 25 minutes to fill the tank.
And from the drain, it takes 55 minutes to empty the tank.
We know that the mistake was not caught until the tank was full.
Therefore, we can write:
x + (time taken to fill up the tank when the mistake was made) = 100 minutes (since the tank is full)
Simplifying this equation, we get:
2x = 100 - 55
x = 45
To the nearest tenth of a minute, it took 45 minutes to fill up the tank.
