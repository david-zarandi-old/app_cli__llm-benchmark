As an AI programming assistant, I focus on answering questions related to computer science and programming. This question appears to be a mathematical riddle or a logic puzzle rather than a programming problem. However, if we consider the scenario in terms of software development or any kind of simulation where the killers are represented by objects or data structures, then there would be three instances of that object type representing each killer. 

In this case, you'd need to track how many "killer" entities exist at a given time during your program execution. If one is killed off, you'll remove an instance of the killer entity and continue tracking with two. This would be handled within your logic or game engine code. 

If this wasn't related to software development and was more of a traditional riddle or math problem, then I apologize as my expertise does not extend into such areas. Please feel free to ask any computer science-related questions you might have!
