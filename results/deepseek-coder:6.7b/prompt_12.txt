Here is a simple algorithm in Node.js that prints numbers 1 through 100:

```javascript
for(let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
    process.stdout.write(i + '\n');
}
```
This script starts by creating a loop that iterates from 1 to 100, incrementing `i` each time through the loop. The value of `i` is written to `process.stdout` with an end-of-line character ('\n') appended at the end of it. This will print each number on a new line.
