The correct order to write this short story would be:
1. "One day Bruce was called to an accident scene."
2. "He was scared until he found out she was ok."
3. "Bruce was a police officer who handled traffic accidents."
4. "He usually saw really bad accidents and it always unnerved him."
5. "He immediately recognized his friend Tanya's car." 

This would create a coherent story where the incidents were happening in chronological order, from when Bruce first became involved to when he recognizes Tanya's car.
