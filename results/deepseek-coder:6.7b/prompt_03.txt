The efficiency of drying shirts in the sun can vary based on many factors such as the type and condition of the material, exposure time, humidity levels, etc. However, assuming a constant rate of drying, if it takes 4 hours to dry one shirt, then it would still take just over an hour for two shirts to dry because each shirt requires half the time (1/2 * 4 = 2).
