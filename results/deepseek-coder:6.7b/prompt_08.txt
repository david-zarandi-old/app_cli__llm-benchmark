This is a mathematical problem, not directly related to computer science. However, in terms of logic and mathematics, it's possible for Sam to be faster than Jane if we assume that each person can complete a task at different speeds (in hours, minutes or seconds). So, the chain of speed might look like this: Jane is slower than Joe who is slower than Sam. 

If you want to programmatically solve such problem, it would require knowledge about algorithms for solving logical relationships between variables in programming languages. But remember that it's not a typical scenario in programming or computer science problems.
