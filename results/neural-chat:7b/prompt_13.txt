 The given algorithm is a recursive function called f which takes a number n as input and returns the result. Let's analyze the time complexity by examining the base case (n < 2), which simply returns n, and the recursion cases (n >= 2). In these cases, we have two calls to f(n - 1) and f(n - 2). Each call of f takes time proportional to the number of function calls. The runtime grows linearly with each additional level of the function calls.

To determine the time complexity, we can think about the worst-case scenario where all recursive calls are executed sequentially without any optimization. In that case, for a large enough input n, the number of recursive calls will be approximately equal to Fibonacci numbers (or its equivalent form, i.e., 2^n). Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially with their index, so we can conclude that the time complexity of this algorithm is exponential in terms of the input 'n'.
