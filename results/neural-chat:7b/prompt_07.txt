 The marble is inside the cup, and the cup with the marble in it is now positioned upside down on the table. When the person lifts the cup from the table and places it inside the microwave, they are putting the cup along with its contents (the marble) into the appliance. So, during this process, the marble remains within the cup but has simply been moved to a new location - from the table to the microwave.
