 To find out how long 20 shirts would take to dry, we first need to determine the rate at which one shirt dries. Since it takes 4 hours to dry 5 shirts, we can divide the total time by the number of shirts.

Total time for 5 shirts = 4 hours
Dry rate per shirt = Total time / Number of shirts = 4 hours / 5 shirts = 0.8 hours per shirt

Now, if we multiply this dry rate by the number of shirts (20), we can find out how long it would take for all 20 shirts to dry.

Time to dry 20 shirts = Dry rate per shirt * Number of shirts = 0.8 hours per shirt * 20 shirts = 16 hours

So, 20 shirts would take approximately 16 hours to dry in the sun if they are all laid out at the same time and dried under similar conditions as the initial 5 shirts.
