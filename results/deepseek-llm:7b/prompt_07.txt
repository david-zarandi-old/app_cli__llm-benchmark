If the cup is placed upside down on a table and then put into the microwave, it's possible that the small marble may be either inside the cup or outside of it. However, in both cases, it would not remain in its original position when lifted up from the cup. The heat generated by microwaving could also cause some damage to the marble due to high temperatures reaching and melting it.
