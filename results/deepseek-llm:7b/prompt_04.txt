First, we need to follow the order of operations, which states that we should perform any calculations within parentheses first. In this case, there are no parentheses. Next, we need to multiply:

4 * 2 = 8

Now, we can simplify the expression further by performing the addition and subtraction:

25 - 8 + 3 = 17

So, the final answer is \boxed{17}.
