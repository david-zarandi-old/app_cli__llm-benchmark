To find David's average speed, we need to divide the total distance he wants to travel (480 kilometers) by the time it will take him to drive there (6 hours).

Average Speed = Distance / Time

Average Speed = 480 km / 6 hours

Average Speed = 80 km/h

So, David needs to drive at an average speed of 80 kilometers per hour.
