Let $x$ be the time it took to fill up the tank. 
Since the inlet pipe can fill the tank in 25 minutes, we have that $\frac{1}{x}=\frac{1}{25}$. 
Since the drain of the tank can empty the tank in 55 minutes, we have that $\frac{1}{x+55}=\frac{1}{60}$. 
Multiplying these two equations together gives us \[
\frac{1}{(x)(x+55)}=\frac{1}{25}\cdot\frac{1}{60}.
\] Simplifying the right side, we have $\frac{1}{x(x+55)}=\frac{1}{15}$. 
Cross-multiplying gives us $15=x$, so it took $\boxed{\textcolor{red}{9.4}}$ minutes to fill up the tank.
The answer is: 9.4
